P3 (Low): TC-261 to TC-269 (9 test cases)

Advanced scenarios
Complex integrations



Test Coverage:
✅ Core Functionality - Four Program Selection Methods:

-apf (allow by path): Authorize program by full path
-api (allow by index): Authorize program by index, moves from blocked to allowed
-b (block by index): Block program by index, moves from allowed to blocked
-bpf (block by path): Block program by full path

✅ ACL Association (-A):

Assign ACL ID to program for runtime validation
ACL ID 0 = built-in "allow access" (default when -A not specified)
User/group ACL required (not program ACL)
Empty ACL not allowed
Same functionality as acl_program command

✅ Key Features:

Shared libraries evaluation (takes time)
Learning mode usage (-bpf prevents auto-add)
Move between allowed and blocked lists
Disabled after finalize command
Programs must be monitored by SG (not in DG-protected directories)

✅ Integration:

Works with view command (index numbers)
Works with acl_program (equivalent for ACL assignment)
Works with protect (authorized programs can access)
Works with finalize (disables adjust)

✅ System Requirements:

Active modes: Elevated, Learning (doc) vs "only Elevated" (help) - clarify
License type: A
Disabled after finalize
Programs must be in SG-monitored directories

✅ Security:

Warning against general utilities (cat, bash, vi, ssh, etc.)
Trojan malware risk for general utilities
Recommendation to use ACLs with authorized programs
Program location restrictions (no DG-protected directories)

Key Features Tested:

Four Selection Methods: Path-based and index-based for both allow and block
ACL ID 0: Built-in "allow access" when -A not specified
Shared Libraries: Processing time proportional to libraries count
Learning Mode: -bpf prevents auto-authorization in Learning mode
List Movement: -api moves blocked→allowed, -b moves allowed→blocked
Finalize: Permanently disables adjust command
Program Location: Must be monitored by SG, not in DG-protected directories

Important Concepts:
⚠️ ACL ID 0 (Zero): Built-in ACL with "allow access" setting - no restrictions
⚠️ Shared Libraries: Processing takes time - all libraries evaluated
⚠️ Learning Mode: Use -bpf to prevent unwanted auto-authorization
⚠️ General Utilities: Avoid authorizing cat, bash, vi, ssh, etc. (security risk)
⚠️ ACL Recommendation: Use ACLs to limit who can run authorized programs
⚠️ Program Location: Cannot authorize programs in DG-protected directories
⚠️ Finalize: adjust command disabled after finalize (permanent)
Documentation Notes:
DG vs SG:

DG (Data Guard): File protection
SG (System Guard): Program monitoring
Authorized programs must be monitored by SG
Cannot authorize programs in directories with DG protection

ACL ID 0: Fixed, built-in ACL that means "allow access" - always available
Processing Time: "It will take time to process each program being added to the authorized list because every shared library used by the program is being evaluated too."
Security Warnings:

Avoid general utilities (Trojan targets)
Use ACLs to limit who can run programs
Consider program location carefully

Testing Strategy Recommendation:
Test in this order:

Basic program authorization/blocking (TC-004 to TC-084)
ACL association including ACL ID 0 (TC-085 to TC-114)
Program access control (TC-144 to TC-153)
Integration with view and other commands (TC-154 to TC-176)
System prerequisites and restrictions (TC-126 to TC-143)
Documentation examples (TC-204 to TC-213)
Performance tests (shared libraries) (TC-167 to TC-176)
Security warnings and edge cases (remaining tests)

Critical test focus:

All four selection methods work correctly
ACL ID 0 default behavior
Shared libraries processing time
Learning mode prevention with -bpf
finalize disabling adjust
Program location restrictions (SG vs DG)
Move between allowed/blocked lists

Clarifications needed:

Active modes: Doc says "Elevated, Learning" but help says "only available when QDocSE is in Elevated Mode" - which is correct?
