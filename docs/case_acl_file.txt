Test Coverage:
✅ Core Functionality:

Required -d directory option
Required -A or -P (or both) ACL ID options
ACL ID validation and type checking
Recursive directory processing by default

✅ Pattern Matching:

Optional -dp matching pattern (glob rules)
Optional -excl excluding pattern
Pattern order: -dp matches first, -excl removes last
All glob(7) pattern types: *, ?, [], {}, etc.
Pattern quoting to prevent shell expansion

✅ ACL Application:

Setting new ACL IDs
Updating existing ACL IDs
Partial updates (only -A or only -P)
Preservation of unspecified ACL IDs
Recursive processing

✅ File Selection:

All files by default (no pattern)
Pattern-based selection
Pattern-based exclusion
Combined pattern and exclusion
Non-matching files remain unchanged

✅ Error Handling:

All 10 documented error messages
Directory existence validation
ACL ID existence validation
Permission checks
Path length limits

✅ Integration:

Works with ACL configuration from other commands
Applies ACLs created with acl_create/acl_add
Validates ACL IDs exist
Enables file protection

✅ Advanced Features:

Glob pattern matching (glob(7) rules)
Recursive subdirectory processing
Include and exclude patterns
Pattern matching order
File type handling

Key Features Tested:

Recursive Processing: By default applies to all files and subdirectories
Pattern Flexibility: Glob patterns for fine-grained file selection
Exclusion Capability: Exclude specific patterns from matching
Pattern Order: -dp adds to list first, -excl removes from list last
Partial Updates: Can update only user/group ACL or only program ACL
ACL Type Validation: Ensures -A gets user/group ACL, -P gets program ACL

Important Notes:
⚠️ Recursive by Default: Without patterns, applies to ALL files in directory and subdirectories
⚠️ Pattern Quoting: Patterns should be single-quoted to prevent shell expansion
⚠️ Pattern Order: -dp matches are added first, then -excl matches are removed
⚠️ Non-Matching Files: Files not matching pattern remain unchanged (ACL IDs preserved)
⚠️ Glob Rules: Follows glob(7) standard (see manual page Appendix C reference in doc)
⚠️ ACL Type Validation: Must use correct ACL type (-A for user/group, -P for program)
Testing Strategy Recommendation:
Test in this order:

Required options (TC-001 to TC-035)
Basic functionality without patterns (TC-085 to TC-095)
Simple pattern matching (TC-036 to TC-062)
Exclude patterns and combinations (TC-067 to TC-084)
Verification tests (TC-114 to TC-120)
Error handling (TC-155 to TC-170)
