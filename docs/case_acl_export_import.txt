Yes, combining acl_export and acl_import into one test suite is highly recommended because:

They are complementary operations - export creates files that import consumes
Round-trip testing is essential - export → import → verify is a critical workflow
They share similar structure - both have single -f option, similar prerequisites
Integration testing is more important than isolated testing - the value is in ensuring data integrity across the export/import cycle

✅ Error Scenarios:

Export: 6 documented error types
Import: 11 documented error types

Key Testing Focus Areas:

Round-Trip Integrity: Most critical - data must survive export/import perfectly
Configuration Override: Import completely replaces existing configuration
File Format Validation: Magic number and hash verification
Cross-System Portability: Export from one system, import to another
Error Detection: Comprehensive validation (especially import has 11 error types)
Data Preservation: All ACL properties must be preserved exactly

Important Notes:
⚠️ Configuration Override: Import completely replaces existing ACL configuration - all previous ACLs are lost
⚠️ File Protection: Documentation notes that "specific files will still need ACL IDs set" after import
⚠️ File Format: Binary format with magic number and hash for integrity verification
⚠️ No Merge: Import doesn't merge with existing config - it's complete replacement
Testing Strategy Recommendation:
Test in this order:

Basic export/import (TC-001 to TC-097)
Round-trip testing (TC-124 to TC-144) - Most Critical
Error handling (TC-062 to TC-070, TC-105 to TC-123)
Cross-system testing (TC-145 to TC-153)
Performance and edge cases (remaining tests)
