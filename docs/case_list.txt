List specific directory (-d directory_path)
List specific file (-d file_path)
Works on any directory (not just QDocSE protected)

✅ File Status Labels (13 types):

audited: File is audited
block: Block special device
character: Character special device
encrypted: File encrypted (with cipher type in brackets)
fifo: Unix FIFO device
folder: Directory
integrity: Data file monitored for change/access, shows status
link: File linked to another
monitored: Program/library monitored, shows status (authorized settings)
normal: Not guarded or monitored by QDocSE
not_encrypted: File is not encrypted
protected: Access limited by QDocSE
shielded: Read-only by QDocSE (self-defense)
socket: File socket
special: Strongly protected by QDocSE, no access (self-defense)

✅ Display Components:

File/directory name
Status labels (can have multiple)
File mode (permissions: rwxr-xr-x)
Cipher type for encrypted files (in brackets)
Monitoring status for monitored/integrity files

✅ System Requirements:

Active modes: De-elevated, Elevated, Learning (works in ALL modes)
License type: All (works with ANY license)
No special prerequisites

✅ Integration:

Shows protected status (from protect command)
Shows encrypted status and cipher (from encrypt command)
Shows monitored status (from adjust/authorize)
Shows audited status (from audit command)
Shows shielded/special (self-defense)

Key Features Tested:

Universal Access: Works in all modes, all license types
Any Directory: Can list QDocSE and non-QDocSE directories
Comprehensive Labels: 15 different status labels
Multiple Labels: Files can have multiple labels simultaneously
Cipher Display: Encrypted files show cipher type in brackets
File Mode: Shows Unix permissions for each file
Self Defense: Special and shielded files for QDocSE protection

Important Label Meanings:
Protection Types:

protected: Access controlled by QDocSE
shielded: Read-only (self-defense mechanism)
special: No access (self-defense, strongly protected)

Encryption:

encrypted: File is encrypted, cipher shown in brackets: encrypted (AES)
not_encrypted: File is not encrypted

Monitoring:

monitored: Programs/libraries monitored for change/access, shows authorization
integrity: Data files monitored for change/access, shows status
audited: File access is audited/logged

File Types:

normal: Regular file, not QDocSE guarded
folder: Directory
link: Symbolic or hard link
block, character, fifo, socket: Special file types

Self Defense:
According to documentation, refer to "Self Defence on page 26" for details about:

special files: Strongly protected, no access
shielded files: Read-only protection

These are QDocSE's self-protection mechanisms.
Output Format:
Expected to show for each file:

File name
Status labels (encrypted, protected, normal, monitored, audited, etc.)
Cipher type (if encrypted) - in brackets
File mode (permissions)
Status information (for monitored/integrity files)

Testing Strategy Recommendation:

Integration with other commands (TC-140 to TC-154)
Documentation examples and definitions (TC-174 to TC-189)
Special file types and edge cases (remaining tests)

Critical test focus:

All 15 label types correctly identified
Multiple labels can apply to same file
Cipher type shown in brackets for encrypted files
File mode (permissions) displayed correctly
Works on any directory (not just QDocSE protected)
Works in all modes with all license types

Key validation points:
