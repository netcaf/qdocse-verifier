Usability tests


P3 (Low): TC-248 to TC-253 (6 test cases)

Edge case displays
Complex configuration display



Test Coverage:
✅ Core Functionality:

List all ACLs (no options)
List specific ACL (-i option)
Display ACL IDs
Display entry counts (zero or more)

✅ Entry Display Components:

Entry numbers (sequential, usable with acl_remove/acl_edit)
Entry type (Allow or Deny)
User/Group/Program (UID/GID/index with readable name)
Mode (r, w, x combinations)
Time restrictions (days and times)
Program options (-b, -l)

✅ Special Messages:

"No entries (Deny)" for empty ACLs
"Pending configuration: see push_config command" when changes not pushed
"No ACL configuration file found" error

✅ Display Format:

Clear ACL sections
Clear entry sections
Entry numbering for use with other commands
Readable names (user, group, program path)
Time format (HH:MM:SS, day abbreviations)
Consistent formatting

✅ Entry Evaluation Logic (Documentation):

UID/GID/index + mode + time = action (Allow/Deny)
UID match but mode/time fail = Deny
UID no match = skip to next entry
No entries or all checked = Deny (default)
First-match evaluation order

✅ Integration:

Shows ACLs from acl_create
Shows entries from acl_add
Shows updated order from acl_edit
Doesn't show destroyed ACLs
Entry numbers match acl_remove/acl_edit usage

✅ Output Requirements:

Goes to stdout
Redirectable to file
Pipeable to other commands
Parseable format
Consistent structure

Key Features Tested:

Information Display: Complete ACL and entry details
Entry Numbering: Sequential numbers usable with acl_remove/acl_edit
Entry Evaluation Logic: Documentation describes first-match, skip logic
Default Deny: "No entries (Deny)" and "all checked = Deny"
Pending Changes: Shows when configuration needs push_config
Readable Format: Shows both IDs/indices and readable names
Complete Details: Type, user/group/program, mode, time all displayed

Important Display Components (from Documentation):
For each ACL:

ACL ID

For each entry (if any):

Entry number (position)
Type (Allow or Deny)
User/Group/Program (UID/GID/index + readable name)
Mode (r, w, x)
Time restrictions (days and times)

Special displays:

"No entries (Deny)" when ACL is empty
"Pending configuration: see push_config command" when applicable

Documentation Notes on Entry Evaluation:
The documentation extensively describes how entries are evaluated:

Match all three: UID/GID/index + mode + time → action (Allow/Deny)
Match UID but not mode/time: → Deny
No UID match: → Skip to next entry
No entries or all checked: → Deny (default)

This evaluation logic should be understandable from the display (entry order matters, first-match wins).
Testing Strategy Recommendation:
Test in this order:

Basic list functionality (TC-001 to TC-020)
Entry display components (TC-021 to TC-082)
Complete entry display (TC-099 to TC-107)
Integration with other commands (TC-154 to TC-170)
Documentation verification (TC-194 to TC-208)
Usability and output format (remaining tests)

Critical verification points:

Entry numbers are usable with acl_remove/acl_edit
"No entries (Deny)" message appears correctly
All display components present (type, user/group/program, mode, time)
Pending configuration message appears when needed
Output is clear, readable, and parseable
